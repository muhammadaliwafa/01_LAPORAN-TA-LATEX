\textit{Power transformers are one of the fundamental components in electrical transmission systems. This is because power transformers basically play a role in reducing power losses in the transmission process by increasing the voltage during the transmission process at long distances. Therefore maintenance activities in ensuring the condition of the power transformer can work properly become important to do. However, the process of determining the condition of the transformer lasts for a long time and must be done by a reliable engineer. 
In this Final Project, a machine learning-based power transformer health index diagnosis is designed with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method. The design was done with some changes to the number of hidden layers, activation function and data set ratio that used during training and testing. As a result, in the first case the best accuracy was obtained 99\% in the training process and in the second case obtained a model that diagosis without errors during testing. The best model produced is then implemented in an application embedded in a digital device.}
